# greetingcardmaker for U&I Trust

There's not much of a installation guide now, but will eventually put one. Basically you need ollama and a couple of more libraries (odds are that you already have them installed), currently it works on Llama3 but you can change it up to anything you want. This was built like 2-3 months ago, so I'm sure there's better alternatives out there already (will update soon since this whole project was built in like 2-3 hours). 


## Usage
Just put your volunteers names in the csv file and image, add the path to the app.py code
